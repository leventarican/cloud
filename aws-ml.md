# Module 1
* Knowledge engineering: Knowledge + Software = Decision
* the model should human-like decision. if not then debug until it do.  
* AI > ML > DL
* _Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence or AI. Machine learning uses data, and this data is going to be used to train the model, and the model is then used for predictions._

# Module 2

## tl;dr
* key terms
* framework for ml
* ml algorithms for business problems
* ml pipeline

## how amazon get into ML
* Amazon used machine learning to improve the whole routing system. 
* ML pipeline
    * collecting and integrating data
    * prepare the data,
    * visualize it for analysis,
    * select the features you (engineers) want to use
    * train your model,
    * evaluate it 
    * and deploy it.

## example: creditcard transactions
* fraud detection

## binary classification
* ex. customer calls service and the ML should predict if customer issue is calling about his new TV or not. so the binary classification _TV_ or _not TV_.

## regression problem
* we are looking for continous values such as number: _1, 2, 3, ..._
* ex. predict the price of a product
